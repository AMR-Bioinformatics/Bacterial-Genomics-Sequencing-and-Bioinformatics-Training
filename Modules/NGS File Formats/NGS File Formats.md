### Fastq file
FASTQ files are text files containing sequence data with a quality (Phred) score for each base, represented as an ASCII character.

## Phred Quality Scores Explained

Phred quality scores (`Q`) are logarithmically related to base-calling error probabilities (`P`) and are defined as:

Q = -10 * log10(P)


This relation can also be expressed as:

P = 10^(-Q/10)


For example:
- If `Q = 30`, the probability that this base is called incorrectly is **1 in 1,000**.

### âœ… Quick Reference Table

| **Phred Quality Score (Q)** | **Probability of Incorrect Base Call (P)** | **Base Call Accuracy** |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 10                           | 1 in 10                                    | 90%                     |
| 20                           | 1 in 100                                   | 99%                     |
| 30                           | 1 in 1,000                                 | 99.9%                   |
| 40                           | 1 in 10,000                                | 99.99%                  |
| 50                           | 1 in 100,000                               | 99.999%                 |
| 60                           | 1 in 1,000,000                             | 99.9999%                |
