# Bacterial-Genomics-Sequencing-and-Bioinformatics-Training
# üß¨ Sequencing and Bioinformatics Training Course

Welcome to the official repository for the **Bacterial Genomics: Sequencing and Bioinformatics Training Course**. This one-week intensive training course is organized by the MicroHub Laboratory Kericho (MHK) to provide the participants with a comprehensive introduction to sequencing workflows and bioinformatics analysis, with a focus on bacterial genomics. The course is designed for laboratory scientists, researchers, and students who wish to understand the end-of-the-end process of Bacterial DNA sequencing and Bioinformatics analysis. Participants will engage in both hands-on wet-lab activities and practical bioinformatics sessions.
